# Dart Reduce Method Error Handling
This example demonstrates a common error when using Dart's `reduce` method with an empty list. The `reduce` method requires at least one element to perform the reduction operation. Attempting to use it on an empty list throws a `StateError`.

The solution demonstrates how to handle this case using a conditional check or by providing a default value.
